\emph{Bayesian Exploration} is a game between a principal and $T$ agents who arrive one by one. Each round $t$ proceeds as follows: a new agent $t$ arrives, receives a message $m_t$ from the principal, chooses an action $a_t$ from a fixed action space $\A = \{1,...,K\}$, and collects a reward $r_t\in \{0,1\}$ that is immediately observed by the principal. 

Each action $a \in \A$ has a state $\mu_a$ drawn from $\D_a$ before the game starts. For agent in round $t$ who takes action $a_t$, the reward $r_t$ is distributed as $\Ber(\mu_{a_t})$.  

The messages $m_t$ are generated according to a randomized online algorithm $\pi$ termed ``recommendation policy".
