\xhdr{Our scope.} Prior work on incentivizing exploration, with or without monetary incentives, achieves much progress (more on this in ``related work"), but relies heavily on the standard assumptions of Bayesian rationality and the ``power to commit" (\ie users trust that the principal actually implements the policy that it claims to implement). However, these assumptions appear quite problematic in the context of recommendation systems. In particular, much of the prior work suggests disclosure policies that merely recommend an action to each agent, without any other supporting information, and moreover recommend exploratory actions to some randomly selected users. This works out extremely well in theory, but it is very unclear whether users would trust the principal to implement the stated policy and, even if they do, whether they would react to it rationally. Several issues are in play: to wit, whether the principal intentionally uses a different disclosure policy than the claimed one (\eg because its incentives are not quite aligned with the users'), whether the principal correctly implements the policy that it wants to implement, whether the users trust the principal to make correct inferences on their behalf, and whether they find it acceptable that they may be singled out for exploration. Furthermore, regardless of how the users react to such disclosure policies, they may prefer not to be subjected to them, and leave the system.

We strive to design disclosure policies which mitigate these issues and (still) incentivize a good balance between exploration and exploitation. While some assumptions on human behavior are unavoidable, we are looking for a class of disclosure policies for which we can make plausible behavioral assumptions. Then we arrive at a concrete mathematical problem: design policies from this class so as to optimize performance, \ie  the induced explore-exploit tradeoff. Our goal in terms of performance is to approach the performance of the social planner.

\xhdr{Our model.}
For the sake of intuition, let us revisit the \emph{full-disclosure policy} that reveals the full history of observations from the previous users. We interpret it as the ``gold standard": we posit that users would trust such policy, even if they cannot verify it. Unfortunately, the full-disclosure policy is not good for our purposes, essentially because rational users would \emph{exploit} rather than \emph{explore}. However, what if a disclosure policy reveals the outcomes for every other agent, rather than the outcomes for all agents? We posit that users would trust such policy, too. Given a large volume of data, we posit that users would not be too unhappy with having access to only a fraction this data. A crucial aspect of our intuition here is that the ``subhistory" revealed to a given user comes from a subset of previous users that is chosen in advance, without looking at what happens during the execution. In particular, the subhistory is not ``biased", in the sense that the disclosure policy cannot subsample the observations in favor of a particular action.

With this intuition in mind, we define the class of \emph{unbiased-subhistory policies}: disclosure policies that reveal, to each arriving agent $t$, a subhistory  consisting of the outcomes for a subset $S_t$ of previous agents, where $S_t$ is chosen ahead of time. Further, we impose a transitivity property: if $t' \in S_t$, for some previous agent $t'$, then $S_{t'}\subset S_t$. So, agent $t$ has all information that agent $t'$ had at the time she chose her action. In particular, agent $t$ does not need to second-guess which message has caused agent $t'$ to make choose that action.

Following much of the prior work on incentivizing exploration, we do not attempt to model heterogenous agent preferences and non-stationarity. Formally, we assume that the expected reward of taking a given action $a$, denoted $\mu_a$, is the same for all agents, and does not change over time. Then the crucial parameter of interest, for a given action $a$, are the number of samples $N_a$ and the empirical mean reward $\bar{\mu}_a$ in the observed subhistory. We consider a flexible model of agent response: for each action $a$ an agent forms an estimate $\hat{\mu}_a$ of the mean reward $\mu_a$, roughly following $\bar{\mu}_a$ but taking into account the uncertainty due to a small number of samples, and chooses an action with a largest reward estimate. We allow the reward estimates to be arbitrary otherwise, and not known to the principal. 

We measure the machine learning performance of a disclosure policy in terms of \emph{regret}, a standard notion from online machine learning. Regret is defined as the difference in the total expected reward between the best fixed action and actions induced by the policy.

\xhdr{Our results.}
We design transitive unbiased-subhistory policies with near-optimal regret.

\cite{Perchet2015BatchedBP} gives regret guarantees for mult-armed bandit in $M$ batches. They have 2 upper bounds which are similar to our Theorem \ref{thm:llevel-1} and Theorem \ref{thm:llevel-2}.
